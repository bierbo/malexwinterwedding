## For strangers

This is a "source code of life", made for a wedding. If you've searched for something like this, feel free to fork this one.

## For the wedding guests

This is the source code I have made for the book fellow students from marlene and alex have created for the wedding couple.

As it is on github, you can now also contribute. Feel free to add code snippets, comments, and do some code refactoring.
